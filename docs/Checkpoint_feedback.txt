Good checkpoint writeup and presentation.

Looks to be solid progress.  (I like seeing the comments with the `(via
pair-programming)` annotation to communicate that both partners are developing
the code.)

I like the `Ast*<'input>` types that are parameterized by the lifetime of the
input (and, therefore, simply has references in to the input `str`); although,
it does require reading the entire input into a contiguous buffer.

Would love to see the `ll_parser!` procedural macro working, although I wonder
if there will be a mismatch between `proc_macro::TokenStream` and `&'input str`
as the input.  I would suggest going with a `build.rs` approach until the
generator is quite solid.


Score: 10/10
