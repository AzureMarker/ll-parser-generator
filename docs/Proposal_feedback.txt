Nice proposal.

Good testing of the non-IO portions of the project.

Nice to see the combination of CSCI-651 and CSCI-742.

Good stretch goals.

Another stretch goal might be to see whether the parser generator can be
packaged as a library and as a procedural macro --- include a grammar directly
in a .rs file.

Also think about whether the generated code will be entirely stand-alone, or
whether there will also be a parsing engine crate that would need to be depended
upon to use the generated parser.


Score: 10/10
